The dataset was created by consolidating information from an original dataset comprising 600,000 transactional records spanning six years (2014-2019). These records detail the date and time of sale, brand names of pharmaceutical drugs, and the quantities sold. This data was extracted from the Point-of-Sale system of individual pharmacies.

A specific subset of drugs (57 in total) from the dataset has been categorized according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)

M01AB - Anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids, Acetic acid derivatives and related substances
M01AE - Anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids, Propionic acid derivatives N02BA - Other analgesics and antipyretics, Salicylic acid and derivatives
N02BE/B - Other analgesics and antipyretics, Pyrazolones and Anilides
N05B - Psycholeptics drugs, Anxiolytic drugs
N05C - Psycholeptics drugs, Hypnotics, sedatives drugs
R03 - Drugs for obstructive airway diseases
R06 - Antihistamines for systemic use

Implementing a forecasting model for pharmaceutical sales can significantly enhance logistics and inventory management in pharmacies. By accurately predicting the demand for various drug groups, pharmacies can optimize their stock levels, which leads to several key benefits:

Improved Logistics and Inventory Management
Demand Prediction: A robust forecasting model allows pharmacies to anticipate the demand for specific medications, enabling them to adjust their inventory accordingly. This proactive approach helps ensure that essential drugs are always available when needed, thus improving patient care12.

Efficient Stock Replenishment: With accurate forecasts, pharmacies can implement more effective stock replenishment strategies. This minimizes the risk of stockouts and overstock situations, ensuring that inventory levels are aligned with actual demand35.

Cost Reduction
Lower Storage Costs: By maintaining optimal inventory levels, pharmacies can reduce the costs associated with storage. Excess stock not only incurs additional holding costs but also increases the risk of medications expiring before they are sold14.

Minimized Waste: Effective forecasting reduces the likelihood of overstocking, which can lead to wasted resources due to expired products. This contributes to overall cost savings and enhances profitability26.

Enhanced Operational Efficiency
Streamlined Operations: Integrating forecasting models with existing pharmacy management systems facilitates better collaboration across departments. This integration allows for real-time data sharing, enhancing decision-making processes related to inventory management and supplier negotiations13.

Informed Decision-Making: Accurate demand forecasts enable pharmacies to respond swiftly to changes in market conditions or health alerts, ensuring that they can meet patient needs effectively while managing their resources wisely45.


In summary, leveraging a forecasting model in pharmaceutical sales not only enhances logistics and storage efficiency but also significantly reduces operational costs. By understanding time-sensitive demand patterns for different drug groups, pharmacies can optimize their inventory strategies, ultimately leading to improved service delivery and patient satisfaction.
